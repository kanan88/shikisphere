## Key Decisions and Trade-offs

#### 1. Next.js for Framework

- Chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, SEO benefits, easy routing, out-of-box integration with TailwindCSS and TypeScript and clear logical folder structure.

#### 2. State Management

- Used Context API for simplicity and to avoid over-engineering with external libraries like Redux for the simple case as Shortlisting.

#### 3. CSS Framework and Shadcn

- Tailwind CSS was used for rapid styling and customization.

#### 4. Pagination

- Added pagination to improve user experience for large datasets.

#### 5. Testing Scope

- Focused on some components due to time constraints, though broader test coverage is a goal for future iterations.
